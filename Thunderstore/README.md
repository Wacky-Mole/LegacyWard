## Overview

Welcome to LegacyWard, a Valheim mod that introduces a unique protection system for player builds. LegacyWard offers a new gameplay experience by allowing players to explore the world without Admins fearing of their structures being damaged, while also providing a mechanism for claiming and personalizing these builds using a rare token.

### Features

- **Build Protection:** LegacyWard shields player structures from damage, creating a safe haven for your creations in the vast and dangerous world of Valheim.

- **Exploration Emphasis:** With LegacyWard, admins can focus on builds and admin duties without the constant worry of returning to a dilapidated legacy structures.

- **Claiming System:** A rare token is introduced as part of the mod, enabling players to claim a protected build as their own. This adds an element of rarity and strategy to the mod.

- **Reverse Ward Concept:** LegacyWard operates as a reverse ward, safeguarding structures instead of keeping entities out. This innovative approach enhances the immersive nature of Valheim.

## Installation

 **Copy to Valheim Directory:** Copy the mod files into the "BepInEx" folder within your Valheim game directory.

 **Run Valheim:** Start Valheim to experience the LegacyWard mod in action.

## Usage

1. **Build Protection:** Once the mod is installed, admins have two structures they can build normal Legacy Ward which protects out from the middle of the ward or the Legacy Ward Edge, which protects from the parameter of the circle.

2. **Claiming System:** To claim a protected build, obtain the rare token within the game. Use another mod's item/token or Wackydb to generate a item.  The player puts the token in the box and it become theres, the ward deactives allowing building and modifcations. The ward will reactive once the timer runs out.  Deactiving player wards and eventually WIL wards.  This process adds a strategic element to the mod and promotes rare item acquisition.

3. **Explore Freely:** With LegacyWard, players venture into the unknown legacy structures. The players can interact with chests, doors and loot, but stops the players from building/deconstructing and using craftingstations.

## Compatibility

LegacyWard is designed to work with other mods that do not interfere with its core functionality. Ensure compatibility by checking mod compatibility lists or community forums.

This mod deactives normal wards and WIL wards when active. 

I'll add Arcane Ward in the future.
